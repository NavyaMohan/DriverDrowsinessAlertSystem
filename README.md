# DriverDrowsinessAlertSystem
The aim of the project is to create a real time object detection and classification model to alert drowsy drivers using deep learning technologies


## Executive Summary
In today's world, driver fatigue has become one of the leading causes of traffic accidents. Numerous studies show that if a driver is appropriately detected as fatigued and is alerted, the number of accidents can be significantly reduced. Fatigue reduces human response time, making it critical to drive safely. A study in the United States found that drowsy driving was responsible for 20% of fatal crashes. Fatigue is said to be the cause of 20% of commercial transport crashes in the EU. These data statistics are disturbing and demand that the research community pay significant attention to the problem. As a result of these considerations, research in the field of driver state monitoring has accelerated, particularly in areas such as workload estimation, activity identification, secondary task identification, and driving style recognition. Yawning, delayed reaction time, eyelid closure, and a shaky steering grip are all signs of fatigue. With this project we aim at creating a real-time Driver Alert System that reduces delays and instantly alarms drowsy drivers using object detection technologies. This is intended to caution and to help drowsy drivers take control of their vehicle during sleep episodes.

## Deliverables
1.	Data collection, exploration, preparation, and creation of training data
2.	Explore different models and identify the model that best fits the problem
3.	Train the model using the training data and identify the accuracy
4.	Finetune the model hyperparameters for the model and improve the accuracy of the model
5.	Save the model and deploy it for easy use
6.	Detect drowsiness of real-time video feed to alert drivers based on facial expressions
7.	Two types of alerts:
  1.	Eyes closed for 15 seconds or more, high volume alert to wake up the user.
  2.	Yawn 3 times in the span of 30 minutes, an alert is displayed on the screen to alert the user.
